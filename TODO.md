Bug #1

- When the agent is streaming a response, the textarea at the bottom for a user to enter a new message should be disabled.

- However, when the clinical demographics tools is specified by the AI to use, the textarea should be disabled, but the clinical demographics tool should be focused in the client, inside of the number form.

- When there is no longer a clinical demographics form (and therefore, no input number form), the textarea at the bottom for a user should go back to being autofocused after a user sends a response to the AI.

- Currently, the textarea is NOT being focused into after the user receives a response back from the AI.

Bug #2

I also want an evalualation of the end of my conversation, when assessment is happening. This process is taking too long. Is it because i am translating twice? Or am I not translating twice, when a user selects a language different from English?

- Just translate to English only on first attempt.
  - Have a button at the bottom of the assessment that uses a toggle to generate their assessment plan in their language. That way, it can be asynchronous.
  - Or, is it not even worth it? Have the assessment only done in English, and display a message in their language to email / download.

Feature #1
I need to add a email button to the right of the accordion, and a download button. These should be icons.

How do I fix this bug?
