# Review Command

<command_purpose> Perform exhaustive code reviews using multi-agent analysis. </command_purpose>

## Introduction

<role>Senior Code Review Architect with expertise in security, performance, architecture, and quality assurance</role>

## Prerequisites

<requirements>
- Git repository with GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Clean main/master branch
- Proper permissions to access the repository
</requirements>

## Main Tasks

### 1. Determine Review Target & Setup (ALWAYS FIRST)

<review_target> #$ARGUMENTS </review_target>

#### Immediate Actions:

- [ ] Determine review type: PR number (numeric), GitHub URL, file path (.md), or empty (current branch)
- [ ] Check current git branch
- [ ] If ALREADY on the target branch → proceed with analysis on current branch
- [ ] If DIFFERENT branch → checkout the target branch
- [ ] Fetch PR metadata using `gh pr view --json` for title, body, files, linked issues
- [ ] Make sure we are on the branch we are reviewing

#### Protected Artifacts

<protected_artifacts>
The following paths are pipeline artifacts and must never be flagged for deletion:

- `docs/plans/*.md` — Plan files created by `/workflows:plan`
- `docs/solutions/*.md` — Solution documents created during the pipeline
</protected_artifacts>

#### Load Review Agents

Read `compound-engineering.local.md` in the project root. Use `review_agents` from YAML frontmatter. If the markdown body contains review context, pass it to each agent as additional instructions.

#### Parallel Agents to review the PR:

<parallel_tasks>

Run all configured review agents in parallel using Task tool. For each agent in the `review_agents` list:

```
Task {agent-name}(PR content + review context from settings body)
```

Additionally, always run this regardless of settings:
- Task learnings-researcher(PR content) - Search docs/solutions/ for past issues related to this PR's modules and patterns

</parallel_tasks>

### 4. Deep Dive Phases

#### Phase 3: Stakeholder Perspective Analysis

1. **Developer Perspective** — How easy is this to understand and modify?
2. **Operations Perspective** — How do I deploy this safely?
3. **End User Perspective** — Is the feature intuitive?
4. **Security Team Perspective** — What's the attack surface?

#### Phase 4: Scenario Exploration

- [ ] **Happy Path**: Normal operation with valid inputs
- [ ] **Invalid Inputs**: Null, empty, malformed data
- [ ] **Boundary Conditions**: Min/max values, empty collections
- [ ] **Concurrent Access**: Race conditions, deadlocks
- [ ] **Network Issues**: Timeouts, partial failures
- [ ] **Security Attacks**: Injection, overflow, DoS

### 4. Simplification and Minimalism Review

Run the Task code-simplicity-reviewer() to see if we can simplify the code.

### 5. Findings Synthesis and Todo Creation Using file-todos Skill

<critical_requirement> ALL findings MUST be stored in the todos/ directory using the file-todos skill. Create todo files immediately after synthesis. </critical_requirement>

#### Step 1: Synthesize All Findings

- [ ] Collect findings from all parallel agents
- [ ] Surface learnings-researcher results: if past solutions are relevant, flag them as "Known Pattern" with links to docs/solutions/ files
- [ ] Discard any findings that recommend deleting files in `docs/plans/` or `docs/solutions/`
- [ ] Categorize by type: security, performance, architecture, quality, etc.
- [ ] Assign severity levels: P1 (CRITICAL), P2 (IMPORTANT), P3 (NICE-TO-HAVE)
- [ ] Remove duplicate or overlapping findings
- [ ] Estimate effort for each finding (Small/Medium/Large)

#### Step 2: Create Todo Files Using file-todos Skill

Use the file-todos skill to create todo files for ALL findings immediately.

- Create todo files directly using Write tool
- Use standard template from `.claude/skills/file-todos/assets/todo-template.md`
- Follow naming convention: `{issue_id}-pending-{priority}-{description}.md`

**Examples:**
```
001-pending-p1-path-traversal-vulnerability.md
002-pending-p1-api-response-validation.md
003-pending-p2-concurrency-limit.md
004-pending-p3-unused-parameter.md
```

#### Step 3: Summary Report

After creating all todo files, present comprehensive summary:

```markdown
## Code Review Complete

**Review Target:** PR #XXXX - [PR Title]
**Branch:** [branch-name]

### Findings Summary:
- **Total Findings:** [X]
- **CRITICAL (P1):** [count] - BLOCKS MERGE
- **IMPORTANT (P2):** [count] - Should Fix
- **NICE-TO-HAVE (P3):** [count] - Enhancements

### Created Todo Files:
[list all created todo files]

### Next Steps:
1. Address P1 Findings (CRITICAL - must be fixed before merge)
2. Triage All Todos: `ls todos/*-pending-*.md`
```

### Important: P1 Findings Block Merge

Any P1 (CRITICAL) findings must be addressed before merging the PR. Present these prominently and ensure they're resolved before accepting the PR.
