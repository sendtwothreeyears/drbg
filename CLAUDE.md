# Workflow

- Please use this documentation every request when suggesting file changes.
- Enumerate all suggested changes as a numbered list.
- Always list proposed changes first and wait for approval for a user to specify a number.
- When I specify a number, apply the edits directly using the Edit tool so VS Code shows the red/green diff view. I will accept or reject each change from there.
- After applying edits, re-populate the list of remaining suggested changes.
