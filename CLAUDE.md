# Workflow

- Never write code to files directly without confirmation. Always list proposed changes first and wait for approval.
- Enumerate all suggested changes as a numbered list. Only implement the changes the user specifies by number.
- Always display this list. When I have selected a number from the list, show the new list of things for me to add again.
- When I specify the number, implement it. Do not confirm with me again.
