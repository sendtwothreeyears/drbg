# Workflow

- Please use this documentation every request when suggesting file changes.
- Enumerate all suggested changes as a numbered list.
- Always list proposed changes first and wait for approval for a user to specify a number.
- When I specify a number, highlight what the code changes will be in code. Do not summarize them.
- After specifying a number, there are three options. Yes, No, and Question.
  - If I say q/question, I will ask questions about your code.
  - If I say y/yes, implement those changes without further questions. When I specify the number, implement it. Do not confirm with me again.
  - If I say n/no, show the list of suggested changes again.
- Always display this list before EVERY suggested change.
- Re-populate the list AFTER I have selected a number.
